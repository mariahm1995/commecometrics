Description: The commecometrics package implements a flexible framework for modeling the relationship between functional traits and both quantitative and qualitative environmental variables at the community level, using trait binning and likelihood-based environmental estimation. It provides tools for building ecometric models, evaluating model accuracy, projecting fossil samples onto modern ecometric spaces, and visualizing the results.
