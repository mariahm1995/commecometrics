This is a minor update to version 1.1.1.

* Fixed continent assignment in `summarize_traits_by_point()`.
* Updated sensitivity analysis functions to preserve user-provided grid IDs.
* Added a new author to package metadata.
* No API changes or new dependencies.

I have addressed the comments from Benjamin Altmann from 07/21/2025.
