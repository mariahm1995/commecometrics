## Comments

This is a minor update to version 1.0.1.

* Fixed a bug in `reconstruct_env_qual()` that affected the reconstruction of qualitative environmental variables.
* Minor documentation improvements.
* No API changes or new dependencies.

I have addressed the comments from Benjamin Altmann from 07/21/2025.
